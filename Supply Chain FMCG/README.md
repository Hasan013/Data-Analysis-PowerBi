## 🎯 Project Overview

This project tackles a common supply chain challenge in the FMCG space by identifying why key customers are not renewing contracts.  
> These are the kind of insights e-commerce operators and growth teams need to **improve service quality, reduce churn** and **scale reliably**.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem

AtliQ Mart is losing high-value customers because orders are not delivered **on time** or **in full**, a common challenge for fast-growing DTC and FMCG brands where **operations, customer experience** and **retention** are tightly linked.

The team needs a clear, metrics-driven view of performance so they can make smarter decisions and prevent contract losses.

---

## ✅ Project Objective

Step into the role of a **Supply Chain Analyst**:

- Define and track 3 key KPIs:
  - **OT% (On-Time)**
  - **IF% (In-Full)**
  - **OTIF% (On-Time In-Full)**
- Analyze trends across customers and time
- Align insights with business expectations from stakeholder reviews

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- OT%, IF% and OTIF% are **consistently below target**  
- **Daily performance trends** show repeated misses  
- **IF% is especially weak** for several key customers → this threatens retention  
- **No major improvements** in recent weeks → action is urgent

---

## 🔍 Business Impact & Opportunities

- Fixing delivery issues can improve **customer retention** and **renewals**  
- OTIF metrics help align operations, logistics and CX teams around shared goals  
- Addressing IF% gaps early avoids **revenue leakage** and **reputational damage**  
- Clear metrics support **data-driven decisions** across the supply chain  

---

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Used

- 🛠️ **Power BI** – for modeling, visuals and interactive reporting  
- 📈 Created KPIs using DAX: OT%, IF%, OTIF%  
- 🧩 Used features like Sparklines, Buttons, Bookmarks for better UX  
- 📚 Learned supply chain metrics and how to apply them in a business context
